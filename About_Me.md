My career began in the field of economics and finance, where I earned my **B.Sc. (Hons) in Economics and Finance** from the Lahore School of Economics and later pursued an **MS in Economics** from the University of Central Punjab. During my academic years, I developed a keen interest in data analysis and visualization, which led me to explore tools like **Power BI, Python, SQL, and Excel** to craft compelling data stories.

I’ve had the opportunity to work in diverse roles, from being a **Financial Investment Analyst** at Blue River Financials to serving as a **Planning Officer** in the Primary & Secondary Healthcare Department of the Government of Punjab.

More recently, I worked as a **Coordinator** at Bahria Town School & College, where I leveraged my analytical skills to improve teaching strategies and student engagement. I introduced innovative online teaching techniques and conducted training sessions to bridge the gap between technology and traditional teaching methods. My efforts were recognized by the organization for contributing to student success and program development.
